<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">Programming and studying the modern uses of new technology is the key towards success. Learning and expanding the interests of students can revolutionize and educate a new generation for a better future. This can lead students to finding new passions and give students the opputinties to a larger variety jobs and forthcoming careers. Education is the fuel that kindles our expansion and growth. </p>

<p id="TITLE" style=" color: 5C5C5C; font-size: 50px;">Personal Achievements and Growth</b>

<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">
Programming has opened my eyes to a new world. Understanding the methods and fundamental functions behind coding has brought me to find an increasing interest in programming. Throughout my courses in Expeditions I have learned the differences between software and hardware and how they work in conjunction with each other. I was able to disassemble and reassemble a laptop and take a look into a desktop. I have programmed several websites, a tic-tac-toe game, a calculator, and even a simple AI for my "Vindinium Project".

<p id="TITLE" style=" color: 5C5C5C; font-size: 50px;">Websites</p>


<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">
Throughout this course I have done many projects. In the beginning I completed four websites, about me page, intro page, html Page, and my hardware page. Here are the links to all my websites. Simply click on one the links and you will be moved to one of my websites.<p/>

<p id="TITLE" style=" color: 5C5C5C; font-size: 50px;">Tic Tac Toe</p>
<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">
"Designing my own project" for expeditions class probably helped me learn javascript the most due to its open freedom's and infinite oppurtunities to learn
new and useful methods of coding. As a student I enjoy coding and I found this project very fun and creative. There were almost no limits to what we can create. 
too me, this learning enviornment has opened to explore the endless possibilities of coding.

<p id="TITLE" style=" color: 5C5C5C; font-size: 50px;">Calculator</p>

<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">
Learning how to create a calculator is was probably one of the more interesting projects within thin this course. Formatting and learning how to 
make my html work along with my javascirpt. This was really important because it helped me be more efficent with creating the layout for my calculator. 
I also learned how to create variables in javascript.<p/>

<p id="TITLE" style=" color: 5C5C5C; font-size: 50px;">My Vindinium Project</p>
    
<p id="YOLO" style=" color: C0C0C0; font-size: 30px;">
My final project was probably my most favortie one. This assignment had changed my view on programming in such way that it has given me new
respect for those who code. I have found a new motivation in coding that was discovered by this project. In a short summary. The vindinium project
was based on the creation of AI and what artificial intelligence means. By clicking this link you will be directed towards my vindinium website. <p/>
